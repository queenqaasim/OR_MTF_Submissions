		<p>I hope that the fellows will start making techie tools that help their organizing work. I hope that they train others in their organizations to do the same. I hope that they create a business model around the tools they develop so that they can sustain their organizing work and employ the people. I hope they close all youth prisons and get justice for working mujeres latinas!
